Overview of Thematic Analysis
Thematic Analysis is a research method that allows you to analyse qualitative data in order to answer pre-determined research questions. It can be used as a stand-alone analysis or as part of a wider methodology, alongside other quantitative or qualitative methods.

Thematic analysis can be implemented in a number of different ways, and you can iterate over different parts of the process as required. Typically, your thematic analysis is resouce-bound, in that you will have a set number of data sources that you have generated in order to answer a given research question. These sources might be interview transcripts, survey responses or videos of participants completing tasks, as a few examples.

There are 6 stages of thematic analysis to be completed, based on Braun & Clarke (2006).
