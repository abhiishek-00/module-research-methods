Thematic Analysis

is a research method that allows you to analyse qualitative data in order to answer pre-determined research questions. It can be used as a stand-alone analysis or as part of a wider methodology, alongside other quantitative or qualitative methods.
Typically, your thematic analysis is resource-bound, in that you will have a set number of data sources that you have generated in order to answer a given research question. These sources might be interview transcripts, survey responses or videos of participants completing tasks, as a few examples.

A systematic research method that focuses on identifying patterns of meaning in qualitative data.

  Generating themes- collating codes into potential themes
  Reviewing themes-
